# Planify Server

Planify Server is the backend component of the Planify project planning tool, responsible for handling requests, managing project data, and interfacing with external services.

## About

Planify Server is built using Express.js and integrates with various libraries and APIs to provide robust functionality. It securely manages user authentication, communicates with MongoDB for data storage, and interacts with external APIs such as OpenAI and Twilio for additional features.

## Features

- **Express.js**: Powers the backend server with a minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: Stores project data in a NoSQL database for scalability and flexibility.
- **JWT Authentication**: Implements JWT-based authentication for secure user access control.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Interacts with OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate project plans and insights.
- **Twilio Integration**: Integrates with Twilio's API for sending notifications and alerts via SMS.

## Getting Started

To get the server running:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`.

Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible.
